You probably don't know who is the most important.

I heard that some people don't believe that I can write a debugger for eclipse as a pluggin.
Because first you would have to learn how to write plugins for Eclipse.

Well, for now it looks, that just me can teach you how to write plugins for Eclipse, and this is one from my drawer.

I would have taken care of it earlier, but I have a mandatory visit to a psychiatrist.
There will be something about tolerance.
I'm very afraid of this.
You know how it is in a psychiatrist's office, you go in one door, you go out the other, and then you don't know who you are.
